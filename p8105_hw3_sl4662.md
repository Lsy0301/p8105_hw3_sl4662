Both orders of pink lady apples and coffee ice cream are placed around
noon to 3pm.

There are 15 variables in instacart data set, and 1384617 observations.
This data set is based on each item from different orders and different
times. For example, we can look at the first row. Bulgarian Yogurt has
product id 49302, it is in order 1, and it is added to the cart first.
It is the forth order being placed by user 112108 on Thursday. It has
been 9 days since this userâ€™s prior order. This product belongs to aisle
yogurt and department dairy eggs.

The distribution for poor response is the lowest among other responses.
Fair response has higher data values than poor response, but still low

In the Accelerometers dataset, we have a total of 35 obervations, and
1444 variables.

`activity.*` for every minutes are numeric variables.

`weekday` is logical variables. If `1`, then it is a weekday. If `0`,
then is is a weekend.

`day` is character variables. It contains `Monday` to `Sunday`.

`day id`is numeric variables. It represents the number of days.

`week` is numeric variables. It represents the numebr of weeks.

From the plot, we can see that this person is generally more active on
Friday nights around 9pm and Sunday Mornings around 11am. There is
almost no activity from midnight to the morning, which means this person
is resting from 12am to 7am.
